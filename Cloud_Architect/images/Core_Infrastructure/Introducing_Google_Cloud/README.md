# What is cloud computing?
It has 5 belowing traits:
1. customers get computing resources that are on-demand and self-service.
2. customers get access to those resources over the Internet from anywhere they have a connection.
3. the cloud provider has a big pool of those resources and allocates them to users out of that pool. (That allows provider has a big pool of those resources and allocates them to users out of that pool)
4. the resources are elastic, which means they're flexible, so customers can be. If customers need more resources, they can get more and quickly.
5. customers pay only for what they use or reserve as they go
